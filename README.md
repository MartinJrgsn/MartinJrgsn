- 👋 Hi, I’m @MartinJrgsn
- 🎓 I am an Industry Master student at the University of South-Eastern Norway, pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science.
- 👀 My interests are rooted in software development, but I enjoy the occasional deep dive into RTL hardware development, assembly, and configuring my Linux install (I use Arch btw).
- 🌱 Lately, I've been channeling the knowledge from my Bachelor's degree into developing games and enhancing my skills in languages like C/C++ and Python.
